# 0006. Only behaviour tests run; the sweeps run by hand

## Status

Accepted, 12 November 2026. Amended by ADR 0011, which adds unit tests for the `api` library.
Amends ADR 0003: the sweeps are kept and maintained, but no default command and no CI job
runs them.

## Context

A Playwright suite holds two kinds of test. Behaviour tests: a user does something and the app
answers. Sweeps, generated per screen state, width and theme: visual parity with `docs/mocks`
(`tests/visual/`), responsive fit (`tests/responsive.spec.ts`) and automated accessibility
(`tests/accessibility.spec.ts`). In Jubilee the sweeps were about 90% of the run's time, and
every new screen state added about 24 of them. The repository owner decided that only behaviour
tests run by default.

## Decision

- `npm test` in `e2e/` and the CI e2e job run the behaviour specs only. The sweeps are excluded
  by `testIgnore` in `e2e/playwright.config.ts` unless `PK_SWEEPS=1` is set.
- The sweeps stay in the repository and are still written: a new screen state gets its entry in
  `e2e/fixtures/routes.ts` and its page object regions, so the sweeps cover it, and a new sweep
  is added where a requirement calls for one. Nothing runs them unless the repository owner does
  so by hand, with `npm run sweeps` (which renders the baselines first).
- Agents and CI never run `npm run sweeps`, `npm run baseline` or any other command that sets
  `PK_SWEEPS=1` or `PK_BASELINE=1`.

## Consequences

- The default e2e run stays short, and CI renders no baselines.
- Visual, responsive and accessibility regressions are not caught automatically. They are caught
  when the owner runs the sweeps, or in review.
- Sweeps can go stale between manual runs.
- Behaviour tests must carry any check a requirement makes mandatory and that a sweep would cover
  only incidentally, such as an accessible name or a focus order the user depends on.
